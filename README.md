**About Me**

<div align="justify">

Ah, I see you found my other github account. As much as I pursue other programming languages, I'm hugely biased to mobile development. According to the new GSMA report, dated 11th October 2023, over half (54%) of the global population, some 4.3 billion people, now own a smartphone. If we are being honest, this demograph is glued to their screens. This provides untamed opportunities and the writing is in the numbers. And to think that there is a chnace to develop or contribute by being part of a team that provides a solution, a product or a service accessible through mobile devices to a multitude, I must say, it makes for a noble cause and endearing challenge. And I love those. By now, I guess it's pretty evident how much I love mobile development.

<div align="justify">

I began mobile development in 2020, under the persuasion of my university lecturer, now late, Mr. Kamanu. I have since been contracted to work on different projects. With an interest in the two dominating operating softwares, Android and iOS, I have so far been coding for android using Java. I intend to learn and code flutter, dart, kotlin and swift for iOS.

As of 23rd January 2024, I have not been actively pushing my code on here but that's on course to changing. Also, there are old projects i had not pushed to any version control platform and im going to be uploading those codes here. I'm open to collaborating on projects.

Well, just something up my sleeve.

**My Spotify**

"A house without music is like a body without a soul". A programmer coding without music? I'm yet to find one.

Here's what I'm listening to:
